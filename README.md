# Beyond Meat - Brand Consultation

Beyond Meat is a Los Angeles-based producer of plant-based meat substitutes founded in 2009. The company's initial products became available across the United States in 2012. The company has products designed to simulate chicken, beef, and pork sausage.

Setting ourselves as brand consultants for "Beyond Meat", we ventured into measuring perception difference if any for their products with respect to both general public and customer base. Also evaluated how Beyond Meat fared comapred to their competitors in the vegan meat market in terms of public opinion.

## Project Objectives

* Public Perception - Illuminate perceptions and sentiment, for both current buyers and broader public to aid in brand differentiation. 
* User Sentiment - Identify sentiments of customers who have bought Beyond Meat and compare with general public opinion.
* Competitive Landscape - What are the unique advantages and disadvantages Beyond Meat has compared to other brands?

## Approach:

* Scraped Twitter, Reddit using generic keywords and Amazon reviews for BeyondMeat products.
* Cleaned up the data by removing phtos, videos, hyperlinks and nulls.
* Performed sentiment analysis seperately on the above threee sources.
* Topic Modeling on Amazon reviews using LDA
* Lift Analysis on twitter data to measure the perception differences of BeyondMeat products with that of Impossible foods.

## Inferences:

* Majority of general public have positive and neutral sentiments towards vegan products.
* Positive sentiments on Amazon reviews, but ~90% of the positive reviews mentioned "smell" as a negative factor while cooking.
* Through lift analysis, we get that BeyondMeat products are more likely to be associated words describing nutritious content, fast food restaurants and less likely to be mentioned with negative word comapred to their competitor. But they show less association wit trial words like 'first time', 'trying' etc.

## Recommendations to help "Go Beyond":

* Social Media campaigns to increase engagement and project themselves to be the first choice for prospective customers: #GoBeyond    #TryBeyond    #FirstBeyond
* Product enhancement to combat the “smell” issue
* Video recipes and 60 second videos to target younger health and meat-conscious customer segment on best way to cook burger patty
